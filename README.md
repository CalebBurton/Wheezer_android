Contains files related to my work with <b>A</b>dvanced <b>S</b>elf-powered <b>S</b>ystems and <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>S</b>ensor <b>T</b>echnologies center. This <i>Wheezer</i> app will connect via bluetooth to the <i>Wheeze Patch</i> wearable electronic stethoscope.
<br />
<br />
On the mobile client side, the app is being developed on the <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> hybrid platform, which allows concurrent development for iOS and Android. The source code is written in JavaScript that utilizes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> (Angular 1) and, to a lesser extent, the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> framework.
<br /><br />
On the back end, the app connects to IBM's <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/">Bluemix</a> platform, which allows utilization of IBM's <a href="https://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a> NoSQL database software to upload and organize the audio files pulled from the wheeze patch.
